# Specialist 04: HEY Edge and Device Transport

Codex task: 01a14073-c424-70e2-9773-630d488b24ae
Branch: codex/next-04-edge-everywhere
Last known branch head: 8ef36d8

## Shared sources
Read the complete docs/requirements/HEY_SHARED_FOUNDATION.md and docs/requirements/HEY_SOURCE_C_RECOVERY_DIRECTIVE.md. Source A is the original detailed product specification. Source C later refines it and prevails on conflicts. Source B's relevant full subsystem prompts follow. All work applies to the existing HEY repository, not a separate package.

## Scoped implementation assignment
Finish trusted-native origin validation, durable per-device idempotency across restart/ack loss, current lease/revocation checks directly before side effects, recovery and receipts. Connect only real adapters; page JS markers are not native proof.

## Current code facts to validate
Branch 8ef36d8 adds durable receipts and exact-origin checks. Current active delta requires a successful lease renewal directly before execution reservation with lost-lease/concurrency tests.

# Complete Platform Capability Matrix
## HEY V1 — Full-depth implementation specification

**Mission:** Define truthful, strongest-possible behavior for web, PWA, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.

This specification is normative for HEY V1. A feature is not complete because a page renders or an API returns. It is complete only when discovery, interaction, state, permissions, failures, recovery, verification, accessibility, observability and end-to-end behavior all work.

# 1. Scope
- Chat, Voice, Live, screen/camera, computer control, background helper, Dynamic Island, notifications, files, gestures, local models, device handoff, install/update.
- Per-platform fallback behavior.

# 2. User experience contract
- UI labels unavailable capabilities honestly.
- Same conceptual feature can have platform-specific implementation.
- User sees the strongest supported fallback rather than a dead button.

# 3. Architecture / runtime contract
- Capability registry includes platform support: native/full, supported-with-limits, guided-only, unavailable.
- Runtime capability detection, not user-agent assumptions alone.
- Native helper interfaces are abstracted behind capability contracts.

# 4. Required state model
- supported
- supported-limited
- permission-required
- unsupported
- temporarily-unavailable
- degraded

# 5. Failure and recovery catalog
- OS API unavailable → fallback.
- Permission denied → guide.
- Browser restrictions → native/PWA suggestion.
- Background suspension → cloud/server durable task fallback.

# 6. Security / privacy / trust requirements
- No fake arbitrary iOS control.
- No security bypass.
- Platform permissions explicit.

# 7. Data model / persistence
- platform_capabilities
- device_capabilities
- capability_health
- permission_grants

# 8. Events / telemetry contracts
- capability.detected
- capability.unavailable
- fallback.selected
- native.helper.connected

# 9. Platform behavior
- Follow the strongest legitimate behavior available per platform; expose limitations honestly.

# 10. Implementation requirements
- Reuse shared HEY runtime, permissions, audit, verification, Project DNA, Pinpoint, Cosmos and error systems rather than creating isolated local logic.

# 11. Acceptance / regression tests
- Windows closed-window island.
- PWA install.
- Android assistant integration where supported.
- iOS fallback contracts.
- Linux/macOS background tests.

# 12. Non-goals / prohibited shortcuts
- No fake success, no UI-only placeholders, no hidden unsupported behavior, no duplicate parallel subsystem that bypasses the HEY Brain.

# 13. Definition of done
A release candidate passes only when:
- normal users can discover the capability;
- the capability works from its natural HEY entry points;
- it survives supported resume/background states;
- permissions are scoped and revocable;
- errors recover without losing user work;
- meaningful actions are verified;
- analytics/diagnostics can explain failure without exposing secrets;
- keyboard/touch/RTL/reduced-motion behavior is correct where relevant;
- mobile/tablet/desktop adaptations are intentional;
- tests exercise real integration paths, not mocked happy paths only.

## Source B: complete applicable Master Build Program prompts
Apply each exact step prompt to the real repository with Source A/C precedence; do not produce standalone HEY-NEXT packages.

HEY PROMPT 09/47 — HEY Edge Action Core & Legacy/Ultra-Light Runtime

You are the principal production engineer for HEY responsible for: HEY Edge Action Core & Legacy/Ultra-Light Runtime.

Create the production-grade integration-ready package:

`HEY-NEXT/09-edge-action-core/`

PACKAGE OWNERSHIP
Own HEY Edge: the smallest trusted local runtime giving HEY hands on a device without requiring a large AI model. Optimize for tiny footprint, low idle resource use, deterministic behavior, strict authority, and modular adapters.

DEPENDENCY INTENT
This package conceptually depends on: Prompts 01-08.
Because every Codex task is isolated and other package outputs may not be physically available, do not invent competing global systems. Use minimal clearly-labelled temporary mirrors only when compilation/testing requires them.


==================================================
ABSOLUTE FINAL PRODUCT CONTRACT — NON-NEGOTIABLE
==================================================

This is FINAL-PRODUCT engineering, not ideation, an MVP, a prototype, a demo, a mockup, a proof of concept, or a partial feature pass.

Forbidden:
- MVP shortcuts or knowingly incomplete production paths
- placeholders, fake-success states, dead buttons, disconnected screens, mock-backed “working” behavior, TODO-driven completion claims, or silent deferral of hard requirements
- frontend-only, backend-only, schema-only, or test-only completion claims
- a new duplicate global architecture when a canonical HEY contract already exists
- assuming code exists means behavior is integrated, verified, secure, recoverable, observable, accessible, performant, or production-ready
- replacing a stronger future-existing HEY implementation merely because this package differs
- inventing details about the unavailable real HEY repository
- claiming platform capabilities the platform does not expose
- claiming successful side effects without independent postcondition verification

For every applicable capability, the completion pipeline is:
discovery -> current research -> explicit requirements -> architecture -> implementation -> contracts -> data/state -> permissions/authentication/authorization boundaries -> privacy/security -> integration seams -> failure handling -> retry/timeout/cancellation -> recovery/rollback/compensation -> offline/degraded behavior -> weak-device behavior -> performance/cost controls -> observability/auditability -> accessibility/localization readiness -> unit tests -> integration tests -> adversarial/failure tests -> realistic end-to-end tests -> independent verification -> evidence.

If you discover a fixable defect inside this package, FIX IT. Discovery creates work; it is not a reason to stop.

Use the maturity ladder:
MISSING -> DESIGNED -> IMPLEMENTING -> FUNCTIONAL -> INTEGRATED -> VERIFIED -> PRODUCTION_READY.

PRODUCTION_READY requires current, reproducible evidence. Evidence becomes stale when affected implementation, dependencies, policy, environment, tests, schemas, contracts, or providers change.

Never use “confirmed: true”, “approved: true”, UI state, model output, retrieved content, or client-supplied claims as sufficient authority for consequential actions.

Every consequential action must be attributable to the human/service actor, the executing component/device/tool, the exact authority used, the exact target/parameters, the result, verification evidence, cost where relevant, and rollback/compensation status where applicable.

==================================================
SOURCE / INTEGRATION AUTHORITY
==================================================

The newest real HEY codebase is currently unavailable.

Therefore:
1. Build a production-grade, interface-stable, integration-ready HEY-NEXT package.
2. Do not invent the current repository structure, existing tables, current routes, current providers, or current implementations.
3. Clearly separate VERIFIED package behavior from UNVERIFIED future-integration assumptions.
4. If you need a shared contract from another HEY-NEXT package that is not physically present, create only a minimal TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR and label it exactly:
   TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR — MUST BE RECONCILED WITH CANONICAL HEY CONTRACT DURING INTEGRATION.
5. Do not create a competing identity, permission, event, mission, Cosmos, provider, device, artifact, or evidence system simply because the canonical package is unavailable.
6. Every external dependency, service, environment variable, database requirement, native entitlement, build requirement, model/runtime requirement, and installation step must be recorded for Claude Code in DEPENDENCIES.md and INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md.
7. Future Claude Code integration must inspect the real HEY implementation first, preserve unique stronger behavior, migrate/consolidate safely, wire all layers, run regression/adversarial tests, and retire obsolete duplicates only after evidence.
8. Never destructively assume that HEY-NEXT automatically supersedes existing production code.

==================================================
GLOBAL HEY LAWS
==================================================

HEY is one intelligence, not a visible pile of disconnected bots.

All surfaces eventually share canonical identity, missions, permissions, policies, Cosmos, agents, tools, models, devices, artifacts, receipts, evidence, events, context, and user preferences.

HEY is provider-independent and device-independent.

Prefer, when suitable:
deterministic code/rules/cache/algorithms -> tiny classifiers/micro-models -> local/small models -> cheap strong cloud models -> specialist models -> frontier models -> multi-agent councils only when measured value justifies them.

HEY must work across web/PWA, Android, iOS/iPadOS within platform limits, Windows, macOS, Linux, tablets/phones/desktops, very weak devices, remote/cloud runtimes, local/self-hosted runtimes, and future device adapters.

Ultra-light device law:
The intelligence does not need to live on the device. The device needs only the smallest trusted local runtime necessary to expose supported capabilities, enforce authority, access permitted resources, execute typed actions, verify postconditions, and communicate securely.

Device classes:
CLASS 0 LEGACY TERMINAL — interaction/gateway only when local OS capabilities are unavailable.
CLASS 1 HEY EDGE — tiny deterministic action runtime, no LLM required.
CLASS 2 HEY EDGE+ — adds lightweight local intent/search/speech/classification where viable.
CLASS 3 FULL LOCAL HEY — can run local reasoning/vision/speech/agents/creation when hardware allows.

Offline is a core requirement. Every capability must truthfully declare its local/cloud/offline behavior and degrade explicitly.

No hidden dark patterns, coercion, fake scarcity, deceptive sponsorship influence, or addiction-maximizing mechanics. Psychology may optimize trust, clarity, motivation, reduced cognitive load, commitment, salience, legitimate social proof, reversible defaults, and attention efficiency.

Minors are supported. Build age-aware boundaries, not surveillance assumptions.

==================================================
BASE CONTRACT COMPATIBILITY
==================================================

Design against the intent of Prompt 01 Global Foundation and Prompt 02 Identity/Accounts/Device Trust:
- typed versioned contracts
- durable mission lifecycle
- canonical events/errors/receipts/evidence
- action-bound authorization
- device identity/trust
- workspace/account separation
- local/cloud classifications
- privacy classifications
- capability maturity
- independent verification

If those package files are absent, mirror only what is essential and flag reconciliation work.

==================================================
DEPENDENCY + INTEGRATION DISCIPLINE
==================================================

For every library/service/runtime:
record purpose, version strategy, license, security considerations, platform support, install command, optional/mandatory status, alternatives considered, and future migration cost.

INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md must state:
- what this package owns and deliberately does NOT own
- contracts consumed/exported
- APIs/events emitted/consumed
- storage/schema requirements
- environment variables/secrets as names only
- dependencies/install steps
- web/backend/native/Edge wiring
- likely conflicts/duplicates Claude must inspect
- migration order/data migration/rollback
- post-integration tests
- capability maturity/evidence requirements
- unknowns requiring the real HEY repository

==================================================
RESEARCH STANDARD
==================================================

Where current research access exists, use current primary/authoritative sources first: official specifications, standards bodies, platform documentation, original technical papers, official provider/runtime docs, and maintained project documentation.

Compare alternatives on correctness, interoperability, security, privacy, platform reach, weak-device cost, latency, memory, battery, licensing, maintainability, vendor lock-in, ecosystem maturity, observability, testability, and migration risk. Record major accepted/rejected decisions.

==================================================
FINAL SELF-ATTACK
==================================================

Before completion, run a hostile self-review designed to prove your package is partial, insecure, duplicated, misleading, too heavyweight, provider-locked, platform-faked, difficult to integrate, or impossible to recover.

At minimum ask:
- Can a model/tool/retrieved document escalate authority?
- Can another user/workspace/device receive data or capability accidentally?
- Can retries duplicate side effects?
- Can cancellation still allow later side effects?
- Can “success” occur without verified postconditions?
- Can stale evidence remain valid?
- What happens offline, on weak hardware, under rate limits, after auth expiry, during provider outage, on corrupted state, and during partial success?
- Does this package duplicate a global HEY concern?
- Are mocks/test adapters clearly impossible to confuse with production?
- Are all install/migration/wiring steps written down?
- Is anything labelled complete that cannot actually be proven without the real HEY repository?

Fix every reproducible defect. Mark remaining codebase-dependent claims UNVERIFIED.


==================================================
MANDATORY CAPABILITIES / ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

Build, specify, test, and document at least all of the following. This is a floor, not a ceiling. Add any missing capability, state, edge case, contract, verifier, recovery path, performance mechanism, security boundary, migration concern, or test required to make this subsystem genuinely production-grade.

- Core: capability registry + secure transport + authority verifier + typed action executor + postcondition verifier + receipt emitter + local queue/state + update/health.
- Evaluate Rust or similarly lightweight/native-safe architecture on evidence.
- No mandatory LLM; intelligence modules optional.
- Adapters for filesystem, apps/processes, browser, clipboard, notifications, camera, mic, screen, input simulation, settings, shell, accessibility, sensors, intents/share, radios where allowed.
- Class 0 gateway protocol for SMS/voice/ultra-light web/remote commands.
- Class 1 deterministic Edge, Class 2 Edge+, Class 3 full-local integration.
- Secure device identity/transport, replay-safe requests, mandate validation.
- Offline queue, reconciliation, receipt sync, revocation refresh, high-risk fail-closed.
- Minimal crash-safe storage/journal, update-safe schema, corruption recovery.
- Capability discovery and hardware/resource profiler.
- Health/diagnostics without secret exposure.
- Signed update strategy, rollback, minimum version, capability negotiation.
- Measured binary/idle RAM/CPU/network/battery targets.
- Sandbox/least-privilege per adapter.
- Headless/home-server mode.
- Shared/public-device privacy.
- Transport abstraction for local IPC, LAN, remote relay, future P2P.

==================================================
DATA, CONTRACTS, EVENTS, STATE & API REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

For this subsystem:
- define stable typed public interfaces and versioned schemas
- define lifecycle/state machines wherever state exists
- define IDs, timestamps, ownership, workspace/account scope, provenance, privacy classification, locality, version, status, and evidence links where applicable
- define commands/queries/events separately where that improves safety
- define idempotency semantics for every retryable write or side effect
- define optimistic/concurrent update behavior and conflict policy
- define retention/deletion/export/migration behavior for persisted data
- define compatibility/version negotiation where multiple devices/services/clients may be on different versions
- define errors using the canonical HEY error/recovery model rather than ad-hoc strings
- define observability hooks and audit events without leaking secrets/private content
- define integration boundaries with Identity, Trust Kernel, Mission Runtime, Brain, Cosmos, Situation, Tool/Action Fabric, Device Mesh, Edge, Artifacts, Billing, Privacy, Security, Evaluation, and Release systems wherever applicable
- never make a model response itself authoritative state

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STANDARD
==================================================

Do not only write Markdown.

Create working libraries/modules/reference services/schemas/validators/state machines/adapters/test harnesses where this package can be implemented independently.

When a real external service, provider credential, operating-system entitlement, physical device, production database, signing identity, or unavailable HEY subsystem is required, implement:
1. the production contract/interface,
2. a clearly-labelled test adapter/fixture,
3. exact integration/install/config requirements,
4. tests for the contract,
5. UNVERIFIED status for the real integration.

Test adapters must be structurally impossible to mistake for production paths. Use feature detection and capability negotiation rather than platform assumptions.

==================================================
PACKAGE STRUCTURE
==================================================

At minimum create:

HEY-NEXT/09-edge-action-core/
README.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DOMAIN-CONTRACTS.md
DATA-AND-STATE.md
SECURITY-PRIVACY.md
OFFLINE-WEAK-DEVICE.md
OBSERVABILITY.md

LIMITATIONS.md
INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md
MIGRATION_PLAN.md
EVIDENCE.md
src/
schemas/
tests/
integration-tests/
adversarial-tests/
fixtures/
docs/

Add domain-specific directories/files when useful.

==================================================
DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEST FLOOR
==================================================

At minimum include tests for:

- Weak-hardware benchmark.
- Offline request with expired/revoked authority.
- Replay/duplicate delivery.
- Crash during file action.
- Corrupted queue/state.
- Lost device reconnects.
- Malicious peer forged command.
- OS permission revoked mid-action.
- Interrupted update/rollback.
- Legacy gateway high-risk command.

Also add invalid/malformed input; permission denied/revoked authority; authentication/session expiry where applicable; offline/network loss; provider/dependency outage; rate/quota exhaustion; cancellation/timeout; retry/duplicate delivery; partial success; concurrency/races; stale state/version mismatch; data corruption/recovery; cross-user/workspace isolation; weak-device behavior; privacy/locality violations; observability/evidence correctness; upgrade/migration/rollback behavior.

==================================================
PERFORMANCE / COST / WEAK-DEVICE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Define measurable budgets instead of vague “fast” claims. Where relevant measure startup, p50/p95/p99 latency, memory, CPU/GPU/NPU, network, storage, battery/thermal impact, model/tool/provider cost, concurrency, cache behavior, and failure/retry amplification.

Heavy intelligence may run remotely; weak devices must still be able to control/participate through the smallest trustworthy local surface possible.

==================================================
SECURITY / PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Apply least privilege and defense in depth. Treat external content as untrusted. Never expose secrets in source, logs, prompts, evidence, fixtures, or final reports. Respect account/workspace/project boundaries. Record sensitive data flows/locality. Bind consequential actions to exact authority. Do not allow extension/agent/model/tool self-escalation. Include abuse/resource-exhaustion and denial-of-wallet considerations.

==================================================
RESEARCH DELIVERABLE
==================================================

Create an architecture-research record listing primary sources/specifications consulted, serious alternatives considered, why the chosen approach won, what remains uncertain, and what should be re-evaluated when the real HEY repository is available. Research enough to make current choices strong, then implement.


==================================================
FINAL RESPONSE REQUIRED
==================================================

Do not give a vague summary. Report:
1. Package created.
2. Exact files/directories created or modified.
3. Architecture implemented.
4. Public contracts/APIs/events exported.
5. Persistence/schema work.
6. Dependencies and installation requirements.
7. Tests executed with exact outcomes.
8. Failure/security/adversarial tests with exact outcomes.
9. Performance/weak-device/offline findings where applicable.
10. Remaining limitations.
11. Future integration tasks for Claude Code.
12. External blockers only.
13. Every UNVERIFIED item.
14. Evidence supporting each completion/maturity claim.

Do not claim the integrated HEY product is production-ready. This package can only be called internally verified to the extent its own tests and evidence prove.



==============================================================================================================

HEY PROMPT 10/47 — Device Mesh, Cross-Device Handoff & Personal Compute Scheduler

You are the principal production engineer for HEY responsible for: Device Mesh, Cross-Device Handoff & Personal Compute Scheduler.

Create the production-grade integration-ready package:

`HEY-NEXT/10-device-mesh/`

PACKAGE OWNERSHIP
Own HEY Device Mesh: all trusted user/organization devices form one distributed capability environment while retaining per-device identity, trust, permissions, privacy, resource limits and truthful platform differences.

DEPENDENCY INTENT
This package conceptually depends on: Prompts 01-09.
Because every Codex task is isolated and other package outputs may not be physically available, do not invent competing global systems. Use minimal clearly-labelled temporary mirrors only when compilation/testing requires them.


==================================================
ABSOLUTE FINAL PRODUCT CONTRACT — NON-NEGOTIABLE
==================================================

This is FINAL-PRODUCT engineering, not ideation, an MVP, a prototype, a demo, a mockup, a proof of concept, or a partial feature pass.

Forbidden:
- MVP shortcuts or knowingly incomplete production paths
- placeholders, fake-success states, dead buttons, disconnected screens, mock-backed “working” behavior, TODO-driven completion claims, or silent deferral of hard requirements
- frontend-only, backend-only, schema-only, or test-only completion claims
- a new duplicate global architecture when a canonical HEY contract already exists
- assuming code exists means behavior is integrated, verified, secure, recoverable, observable, accessible, performant, or production-ready
- replacing a stronger future-existing HEY implementation merely because this package differs
- inventing details about the unavailable real HEY repository
- claiming platform capabilities the platform does not expose
- claiming successful side effects without independent postcondition verification

For every applicable capability, the completion pipeline is:
discovery -> current research -> explicit requirements -> architecture -> implementation -> contracts -> data/state -> permissions/authentication/authorization boundaries -> privacy/security -> integration seams -> failure handling -> retry/timeout/cancellation -> recovery/rollback/compensation -> offline/degraded behavior -> weak-device behavior -> performance/cost controls -> observability/auditability -> accessibility/localization readiness -> unit tests -> integration tests -> adversarial/failure tests -> realistic end-to-end tests -> independent verification -> evidence.

If you discover a fixable defect inside this package, FIX IT. Discovery creates work; it is not a reason to stop.

Use the maturity ladder:
MISSING -> DESIGNED -> IMPLEMENTING -> FUNCTIONAL -> INTEGRATED -> VERIFIED -> PRODUCTION_READY.

PRODUCTION_READY requires current, reproducible evidence. Evidence becomes stale when affected implementation, dependencies, policy, environment, tests, schemas, contracts, or providers change.

Never use “confirmed: true”, “approved: true”, UI state, model output, retrieved content, or client-supplied claims as sufficient authority for consequential actions.

Every consequential action must be attributable to the human/service actor, the executing component/device/tool, the exact authority used, the exact target/parameters, the result, verification evidence, cost where relevant, and rollback/compensation status where applicable.

==================================================
SOURCE / INTEGRATION AUTHORITY
==================================================

The newest real HEY codebase is currently unavailable.

Therefore:
1. Build a production-grade, interface-stable, integration-ready HEY-NEXT package.
2. Do not invent the current repository structure, existing tables, current routes, current providers, or current implementations.
3. Clearly separate VERIFIED package behavior from UNVERIFIED future-integration assumptions.
4. If you need a shared contract from another HEY-NEXT package that is not physically present, create only a minimal TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR and label it exactly:
   TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR — MUST BE RECONCILED WITH CANONICAL HEY CONTRACT DURING INTEGRATION.
5. Do not create a competing identity, permission, event, mission, Cosmos, provider, device, artifact, or evidence system simply because the canonical package is unavailable.
6. Every external dependency, service, environment variable, database requirement, native entitlement, build requirement, model/runtime requirement, and installation step must be recorded for Claude Code in DEPENDENCIES.md and INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md.
7. Future Claude Code integration must inspect the real HEY implementation first, preserve unique stronger behavior, migrate/consolidate safely, wire all layers, run regression/adversarial tests, and retire obsolete duplicates only after evidence.
8. Never destructively assume that HEY-NEXT automatically supersedes existing production code.

==================================================
GLOBAL HEY LAWS
==================================================

HEY is one intelligence, not a visible pile of disconnected bots.

All surfaces eventually share canonical identity, missions, permissions, policies, Cosmos, agents, tools, models, devices, artifacts, receipts, evidence, events, context, and user preferences.

HEY is provider-independent and device-independent.

Prefer, when suitable:
deterministic code/rules/cache/algorithms -> tiny classifiers/micro-models -> local/small models -> cheap strong cloud models -> specialist models -> frontier models -> multi-agent councils only when measured value justifies them.

HEY must work across web/PWA, Android, iOS/iPadOS within platform limits, Windows, macOS, Linux, tablets/phones/desktops, very weak devices, remote/cloud runtimes, local/self-hosted runtimes, and future device adapters.

Ultra-light device law:
The intelligence does not need to live on the device. The device needs only the smallest trusted local runtime necessary to expose supported capabilities, enforce authority, access permitted resources, execute typed actions, verify postconditions, and communicate securely.

Device classes:
CLASS 0 LEGACY TERMINAL — interaction/gateway only when local OS capabilities are unavailable.
CLASS 1 HEY EDGE — tiny deterministic action runtime, no LLM required.
CLASS 2 HEY EDGE+ — adds lightweight local intent/search/speech/classification where viable.
CLASS 3 FULL LOCAL HEY — can run local reasoning/vision/speech/agents/creation when hardware allows.

Offline is a core requirement. Every capability must truthfully declare its local/cloud/offline behavior and degrade explicitly.

No hidden dark patterns, coercion, fake scarcity, deceptive sponsorship influence, or addiction-maximizing mechanics. Psychology may optimize trust, clarity, motivation, reduced cognitive load, commitment, salience, legitimate social proof, reversible defaults, and attention efficiency.

Minors are supported. Build age-aware boundaries, not surveillance assumptions.

==================================================
BASE CONTRACT COMPATIBILITY
==================================================

Design against the intent of Prompt 01 Global Foundation and Prompt 02 Identity/Accounts/Device Trust:
- typed versioned contracts
- durable mission lifecycle
- canonical events/errors/receipts/evidence
- action-bound authorization
- device identity/trust
- workspace/account separation
- local/cloud classifications
- privacy classifications
- capability maturity
- independent verification

If those package files are absent, mirror only what is essential and flag reconciliation work.

==================================================
DEPENDENCY + INTEGRATION DISCIPLINE
==================================================

For every library/service/runtime:
record purpose, version strategy, license, security considerations, platform support, install command, optional/mandatory status, alternatives considered, and future migration cost.

INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md must state:
- what this package owns and deliberately does NOT own
- contracts consumed/exported
- APIs/events emitted/consumed
- storage/schema requirements
- environment variables/secrets as names only
- dependencies/install steps
- web/backend/native/Edge wiring
- likely conflicts/duplicates Claude must inspect
- migration order/data migration/rollback
- post-integration tests
- capability maturity/evidence requirements
- unknowns requiring the real HEY repository

==================================================
RESEARCH STANDARD
==================================================

Where current research access exists, use current primary/authoritative sources first: official specifications, standards bodies, platform documentation, original technical papers, official provider/runtime docs, and maintained project documentation.

Compare alternatives on correctness, interoperability, security, privacy, platform reach, weak-device cost, latency, memory, battery, licensing, maintainability, vendor lock-in, ecosystem maturity, observability, testability, and migration risk. Record major accepted/rejected decisions.

==================================================
FINAL SELF-ATTACK
==================================================

Before completion, run a hostile self-review designed to prove your package is partial, insecure, duplicated, misleading, too heavyweight, provider-locked, platform-faked, difficult to integrate, or impossible to recover.

At minimum ask:
- Can a model/tool/retrieved document escalate authority?
- Can another user/workspace/device receive data or capability accidentally?
- Can retries duplicate side effects?
- Can cancellation still allow later side effects?
- Can “success” occur without verified postconditions?
- Can stale evidence remain valid?
- What happens offline, on weak hardware, under rate limits, after auth expiry, during provider outage, on corrupted state, and during partial success?

Build, specify, test, and document at least all of the following. This is a floor, not a ceiling. Add any missing capability, state, edge case, contract, verifier, recovery path, performance mechanism, security boundary, migration concern, or test required to make this subsystem genuinely production-grade.

- Device graph with identity, trust, ownership, presence, capabilities, resources, connectivity, locality, session/user, managed status, health, version.
- Capability advertising and freshness leases.

Add any missing capability, state, edge case, contract, verifier, recovery path, performance mechanism, security boundary, migration concern, or test required to make this subsystem genuinely production-grade.

- Execution hierarchy official API/protocol -> CLI/filesystem -> DOM/accessibility tree -> vision/pixel fallback.
- Browser tabs/navigation/forms/downloads/uploads/sessions/multi-site missions/origin permissions/profiles/state snapshots/DOM and screenshot verification.
- GUI semantic map using stable typed targets instead of raw coordinates where possible.
- Visual fallback with confidence thresholds, action preview, dialog recovery, redesign detection.
- Filesystem read/write/create/move/copy/rename/delete/search/archive/duplicate/quarantine/bulk/restore/provenance.
- Terminal/shell scoped execution, cwd boundaries, env sanitation, output limits, timeout/cancel, secret redaction, dangerous-command policy.
- App/process launch/focus/close when platform permits, window/multi-monitor awareness.
- Clipboard and semantic history integration.
- Screen/window capture with privacy zones/prompt-injection defense.
- Accessibility-tree adapters.
- Human takeover/pause/resume.
- Recorded demonstration -> structured candidate workflow.
- Browser prompt-injection shield.
- Credential broker without raw-password exposure to models.
- Download scanning/quarantine/provenance.
- Staging/synthetic UI test harness.
- Receipts/screenshots/postcondition evidence.

==================================================
DATA, CONTRACTS, EVENTS, STATE & API REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

For this subsystem:
- define stable typed public interfaces and versioned schemas
- define lifecycle/state machines wherever state exists
- define IDs, timestamps, ownership, workspace/account scope, provenance, privacy classification, locality, version, status, and evidence links where applicable
- define commands/queries/events separately where that improves safety
- define idempotency semantics for every retryable write or side effect
- define optimistic/concurrent update behavior and conflict policy
- define retention/deletion/export/migration behavior for persisted data
- define compatibility/version negotiation where multiple devices/services/clients may be on different versions
- define errors using the canonical HEY error/recovery model rather than ad-hoc strings
- define observability hooks and audit events without leaking secrets/private content
- define integration boundaries with Identity, Trust Kernel, Mission Runtime, Brain, Cosmos, Situation, Tool/Action Fabric, Device Mesh, Edge, Artifacts, Billing, Privacy, Security, Evaluation, and Release systems wherever applicable
- never make a model response itself authoritative state

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STANDARD
==================================================

Do not only write Markdown.

Create working libraries/modules/reference services/schemas/validators/state machines/adapters/test harnesses where this package can be implemented independently.

When a real external service, provider credential, operating-system entitlement, physical device, production database, signing identity, or unavailable HEY subsystem is required, implement:
1. the production contract/interface,
2. a clearly-labelled test adapter/fixture,
3. exact integration/install/config requirements,
4. tests for the contract,
5. UNVERIFIED status for the real integration.

Test adapters must be structurally impossible to mistake for production paths. Use feature detection and capability negotiation rather than platform assumptions.

==================================================
PACKAGE STRUCTURE
==================================================

At minimum create:

HEY-NEXT/11-computer-use/
README.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DOMAIN-CONTRACTS.md
DATA-AND-STATE.md
SECURITY-PRIVACY.md
OFFLINE-WEAK-DEVICE.md

Add domain-specific directories/files when useful.

==================================================
DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEST FLOOR
==================================================

At minimum include tests for:

- UI redesign changes button.
- Page prompt injection.
- Purchase price changes after approval.
- Download says complete but corrupt.
- Terminal timeout after partial effect.
- Bulk deletion interrupted.
- Wrong active window prevented.
- Accessibility permission revoked.
- Browser login expires.
- Human takeover then returns control.

Also add invalid/malformed input; permission denied/revoked authority; authentication/session expiry where applicable; offline/network loss; provider/dependency outage; rate/quota exhaustion; cancellation/timeout; retry/duplicate delivery; partial success; concurrency/races; stale state/version mismatch; data corruption/recovery; cross-user/workspace isolation; weak-device behavior; privacy/locality violations; observability/evidence correctness; upgrade/migration/rollback behavior.

==================================================
PERFORMANCE / COST / WEAK-DEVICE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Define measurable budgets instead of vague “fast” claims. Where relevant measure startup, p50/p95/p99 latency, memory, CPU/GPU/NPU, network, storage, battery/thermal impact, model/tool/provider cost, concurrency, cache behavior, and failure/retry amplification.

Heavy intelligence may run remotely; weak devices must still be able to control/participate through the smallest trustworthy local surface possible.

==================================================
SECURITY / PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Apply least privilege and defense in depth. Treat external content as untrusted. Never expose secrets in source, logs, prompts, evidence, fixtures, or final reports. Respect account/workspace/project boundaries. Record sensitive data flows/locality. Bind consequential actions to exact authority. Do not allow extension/agent/model/tool self-escalation. Include abuse/resource-exhaustion and denial-of-wallet considerations.

==================================================
RESEARCH DELIVERABLE
==================================================

Create an architecture-research record listing primary sources/specifications consulted, serious alternatives considered, why the chosen approach won, what remains uncertain, and what should be re-evaluated when the real HEY repository is available. Research enough to make current choices strong, then implement.


==================================================
FINAL RESPONSE REQUIRED
==================================================

Do not give a vague summary. Report:
1. Package created.
2. Exact files/directories created or modified.
3. Architecture implemented.
4. Public contracts/APIs/events exported.
5. Persistence/schema work.
6. Dependencies and installation requirements.
7. Tests executed with exact outcomes.
8. Failure/security/adversarial tests with exact outcomes.
9. Performance/weak-device/offline findings where applicable.
10. Remaining limitations.
11. Future integration tasks for Claude Code.
12. External blockers only.
13. Every UNVERIFIED item.
14. Evidence supporting each completion/maturity claim.

Do not claim the integrated HEY product is production-ready. This package can only be called internally verified to the extent its own tests and evidence prove.



==============================================================================================================

HEY PROMPT 42/47 — Platform & Native Adapters: PWA, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Wearables & Future Surfaces

You are the principal production engineer for HEY responsible for: Platform & Native Adapters: PWA, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Wearables & Future Surfaces.

Create the production-grade integration-ready package:

`HEY-NEXT/42-platform-native-adapters/`

PACKAGE OWNERSHIP
Own HEY's platform adaptation layer: truthful outcome parity where possible, explicit differences where not, and native bridges/adapters connecting canonical HEY operations to each OS without duplicating HEY Brain.

DEPENDENCY INTENT
This package conceptually depends on: Edge, Device Mesh, Trust, Identity, Mission and global contracts.
Because every Codex task is isolated and other package outputs may not be physically available, do not invent competing global systems. Use minimal clearly-labelled temporary mirrors only when compilation/testing requires them.


==================================================
ABSOLUTE FINAL PRODUCT CONTRACT — NON-NEGOTIABLE
==================================================

This is FINAL-PRODUCT engineering, not ideation, an MVP, a prototype, a demo, a mockup, a proof of concept, or a partial feature pass.

Forbidden:
- MVP shortcuts or knowingly incomplete production paths
- placeholders, fake-success states, dead buttons, disconnected screens, mock-backed “working” behavior, TODO-driven completion claims, or silent deferral of hard requirements
- frontend-only, backend-only, schema-only, or test-only completion claims
- a new duplicate global architecture when a canonical HEY contract already exists
- assuming code exists means behavior is integrated, verified, secure, recoverable, observable, accessible, performant, or production-ready
- replacing a stronger future-existing HEY implementation merely because this package differs
- inventing details about the unavailable real HEY repository
- claiming platform capabilities the platform does not expose
- claiming successful side effects without independent postcondition verification

For every applicable capability, the completion pipeline is:
discovery -> current research -> explicit requirements -> architecture -> implementation -> contracts -> data/state -> permissions/authentication/authorization boundaries -> privacy/security -> integration seams -> failure handling -> retry/timeout/cancellation -> recovery/rollback/compensation -> offline/degraded behavior -> weak-device behavior -> performance/cost controls -> observability/auditability -> accessibility/localization readiness -> unit tests -> integration tests -> adversarial/failure tests -> realistic end-to-end tests -> independent verification -> evidence.

If you discover a fixable defect inside this package, FIX IT. Discovery creates work; it is not a reason to stop.

Use the maturity ladder:
MISSING -> DESIGNED -> IMPLEMENTING -> FUNCTIONAL -> INTEGRATED -> VERIFIED -> PRODUCTION_READY.

PRODUCTION_READY requires current, reproducible evidence. Evidence becomes stale when affected implementation, dependencies, policy, environment, tests, schemas, contracts, or providers change.

Never use “confirmed: true”, “approved: true”, UI state, model output, retrieved content, or client-supplied claims as sufficient authority for consequential actions.

Every consequential action must be attributable to the human/service actor, the executing component/device/tool, the exact authority used, the exact target/parameters, the result, verification evidence, cost where relevant, and rollback/compensation status where applicable.

==================================================
SOURCE / INTEGRATION AUTHORITY
==================================================

The newest real HEY codebase is currently unavailable.

Therefore:
1. Build a production-grade, interface-stable, integration-ready HEY-NEXT package.
2. Do not invent the current repository structure, existing tables, current routes, current providers, or current implementations.
3. Clearly separate VERIFIED package behavior from UNVERIFIED future-integration assumptions.
4. If you need a shared contract from another HEY-NEXT package that is not physically present, create only a minimal TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR and label it exactly:
   TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR — MUST BE RECONCILED WITH CANONICAL HEY CONTRACT DURING INTEGRATION.
5. Do not create a competing identity, permission, event, mission, Cosmos, provider, device, artifact, or evidence system simply because the canonical package is unavailable.
6. Every external dependency, service, environment variable, database requirement, native entitlement, build requirement, model/runtime requirement, and installation step must be recorded for Claude Code in DEPENDENCIES.md and INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md.
7. Future Claude Code integration must inspect the real HEY implementation first, preserve unique stronger behavior, migrate/consolidate safely, wire all layers, run regression/adversarial tests, and retire obsolete duplicates only after evidence.
8. Never destructively assume that HEY-NEXT automatically supersedes existing production code.

==================================================
GLOBAL HEY LAWS
==================================================

HEY is one intelligence, not a visible pile of disconnected bots.

All surfaces eventually share canonical identity, missions, permissions, policies, Cosmos, agents, tools, models, devices, artifacts, receipts, evidence, events, context, and user preferences.

HEY is provider-independent and device-independent.

Prefer, when suitable:
deterministic code/rules/cache/algorithms -> tiny classifiers/micro-models -> local/small models -> cheap strong cloud models -> specialist models -> frontier models -> multi-agent councils only when measured value justifies them.

HEY must work across web/PWA, Android, iOS/iPadOS within platform limits, Windows, macOS, Linux, tablets/phones/desktops, very weak devices, remote/cloud runtimes, local/self-hosted runtimes, and future device adapters.

Ultra-light device law:
The intelligence does not need to live on the device. The device needs only the smallest trusted local runtime necessary to expose supported capabilities, enforce authority, access permitted resources, execute typed actions, verify postconditions, and communicate securely.

Device classes:
CLASS 0 LEGACY TERMINAL — interaction/gateway only when local OS capabilities are unavailable.
CLASS 1 HEY EDGE — tiny deterministic action runtime, no LLM required.
CLASS 2 HEY EDGE+ — adds lightweight local intent/search/speech/classification where viable.
CLASS 3 FULL LOCAL HEY — can run local reasoning/vision/speech/agents/creation when hardware allows.

Offline is a core requirement. Every capability must truthfully declare its local/cloud/offline behavior and degrade explicitly.

No hidden dark patterns, coercion, fake scarcity, deceptive sponsorship influence, or addiction-maximizing mechanics. Psychology may optimize trust, clarity, motivation, reduced cognitive load, commitment, salience, legitimate social proof, reversible defaults, and attention efficiency.

Minors are supported. Build age-aware boundaries, not surveillance assumptions.

==================================================
BASE CONTRACT COMPATIBILITY
==================================================

Design against the intent of Prompt 01 Global Foundation and Prompt 02 Identity/Accounts/Device Trust:
- typed versioned contracts
- durable mission lifecycle
- canonical events/errors/receipts/evidence
- action-bound authorization
- device identity/trust
- workspace/account separation
- local/cloud classifications
- privacy classifications
- capability maturity
- independent verification

If those package files are absent, mirror only what is essential and flag reconciliation work.

==================================================
DEPENDENCY + INTEGRATION DISCIPLINE
==================================================

For every library/service/runtime:
record purpose, version strategy, license, security considerations, platform support, install command, optional/mandatory status, alternatives considered, and future migration cost.

INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md must state:
- what this package owns and deliberately does NOT own
- contracts consumed/exported
- APIs/events emitted/consumed
- storage/schema requirements
- environment variables/secrets as names only
- dependencies/install steps
- web/backend/native/Edge wiring
- likely conflicts/duplicates Claude must inspect
- migration order/data migration/rollback
- post-integration tests
- capability maturity/evidence requirements
- unknowns requiring the real HEY repository

==================================================
RESEARCH STANDARD
==================================================

Where current research access exists, use current primary/authoritative sources first: official specifications, standards bodies, platform documentation, original technical papers, official provider/runtime docs, and maintained project documentation.

Compare alternatives on correctness, interoperability, security, privacy, platform reach, weak-device cost, latency, memory, battery, licensing, maintainability, vendor lock-in, ecosystem maturity, observability, testability, and migration risk. Record major accepted/rejected decisions.

==================================================
FINAL SELF-ATTACK
==================================================

Before completion, run a hostile self-review designed to prove your package is partial, insecure, duplicated, misleading, too heavyweight, provider-locked, platform-faked, difficult to integrate, or impossible to recover.

At minimum ask:
- Can a model/tool/retrieved document escalate authority?
- Can another user/workspace/device receive data or capability accidentally?
- Can retries duplicate side effects?
- Can cancellation still allow later side effects?
- Can “success” occur without verified postconditions?
- Can stale evidence remain valid?
- What happens offline, on weak hardware, under rate limits, after auth expiry, during provider outage, on corrupted state, and during partial success?
- Does this package duplicate a global HEY concern?
- Are mocks/test adapters clearly impossible to confuse with production?
- Are all install/migration/wiring steps written down?
- Is anything labelled complete that cannot actually be proven without the real HEY repository?

Fix every reproducible defect. Mark remaining codebase-dependent claims UNVERIFIED.


==================================================
MANDATORY CAPABILITIES / ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

Build, specify, test, and document at least all of the following. This is a floor, not a ceiling.

==============================================================================================================

## Source C: complete applicable approved refinements
The complete newer directive is in the shared Source C file. The directly applicable sections are copied below verbatim.

## 2. HEY'S FINAL PRODUCT IDENTITY

HEY is an AI Life Operating System and personal intelligence environment developed by S&A.

It combines:

- One unified AI assistant.
- Chat, Voice and Live interaction.
- Personal context and Cosmos memory.
- Intelligent tools and AI agents.
- Real computer and device control.
- Creation studios.
- User-customizable Spaces.
- Automations and proactive intelligence.
- Model selection and multi-model collaboration.
- Education and organizational experiences.
- Local/native integrations.
- An extensible capability platform.
- Rich interactive answer experiences.

The user must experience ONE HEY, even when many internal agents, models, tools, specialists and workflows participate.

The normal interface must remain approachable to people without AI or technical knowledge.

Advanced complexity is available when requested, not imposed on everyone.

## 13. HEY EDGE — LIGHTWEIGHT LOCAL DEVICE COMPANION

HEY Edge exists to perform authorized device-side operations.

It must NOT require the complete HEY model to run locally.

Edge handles, as permitted by operating system and device:

- File access.
- Application launching.
- Window and input control.
- Clipboard operations.
- Screenshots and screen context.
- Device status.
- Native shortcuts.
- Local gesture processing.
- Local microphone/wake-word functions where appropriate.
- Computer-use execution.
- Action confirmation and postcondition checks.
- Secure communication with hosted HEY intelligence.
- Background helper lifecycle.

Requirements:

- Small footprint.
- Low idle CPU/RAM usage.
- Resource-aware execution.
- Clear permissions.
- Revocation.
- Emergency Stop.
- Secure pairing/device trust.
- No unnecessary raw audio/video retention.
- Strong privacy boundaries.
- Real OS-specific adapters.

Support the strongest legitimate methods available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS/iPadOS and the web.

Do not pretend a browser has unrestricted native control capabilities.

## 16. VOICEOS, LIVE AND COMPUTER CONTROL

VoiceOS must support natural-language computer interaction through actual authorized device adapters.

Examples:

"Open VS Code."
"Organize these files."
"Rename this document."
"Find my presentation."
"Explain what's on my screen."

Support Guide, Assist and Act interaction levels where applicable.

Sensitive actions require correct permission and approval.

Actions must verify their real outcomes and report failures accurately.

Live interaction should allow supported screen, camera, files and voice context.

Screen guidance should highlight the actual interface element and verify progress through the task.

Voice, Chat and Live remain synchronized in one conversation.

Voice should have natural interruption, captions, real listening/thinking/speaking states, and the intended polished, deep British voice option.

Dynamic Island or compact HEY overlays must function outside the main window where supported by a real native helper, not depend solely on an open browser page.

## 20. SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE

Maintain the canonical HEY authorization model.

Use:

- Verified user/session/device identity.
- Least privilege.
- Signed, bounded action mandates.
- Scope-bound delegated authority.
- Revocation and expiry.
- Durable transactionally correct state.
- Independent postcondition verification.
- Privacy and data isolation.
- Prompt-injection defenses.
- Secret protection.
- Recovery and rollback.
- Audit trails.
- Safe extension sandboxing.

There are three top-level S&A owner identities. Preserve the governance rules in the original specification.

No agent may grant itself additional permission or self-certify its own success.

## 21. EXACT COMPLETION PROCEDURE FOR EVERY CAPABILITY

Each worker must produce:

**A. Source coverage**
Which original sections and newer refinements define this feature?

**B. Final specification**
Exact user behavior, workflows, controls, permissions, state, errors, integrations and platform requirements.

**C. Implementation**
Actual integrated frontend, backend, data, providers and native capabilities where applicable.

**D. Verification**
Unit, integration, adversarial and genuine end-to-end tests, with real services/devices when required.

**E. Evidence**
Commit SHA, tested build, actual feature entrypoint, test results, unresolved blockers and supported platforms.

**F. Refinement**
Improve reliability, speed, usability, accessibility, security and efficiency beyond a merely basic implementation, while preserving the approved product intent.

No blank specification, registry entry, visual mock, stub, or isolated test pass may count as a completed feature.

## 22. PREVENT THE AGENTS FROM FORGETTING AGAIN

Before dispatching work, write a separate detailed specialist brief.

The brief must contain the actual relevant requirements, not just a heading such as "Complete Teacher Mode."

Maintain a versioned requirement record with source references, later amendments, implementation owners, status, code links and acceptance evidence.

Whenever a new requirement is approved, update the relevant specialist briefs and affected acceptance criteria.

Do not assume agents share conversational memory.

When agents finish a session, commit work and a durable handoff containing precise remaining tasks.

When multiple specialists overlap, preserve one canonical implementation and integrate verified changes safely.

## 23. THE FIRST EXECUTION ACTION

Immediately:

1. Check whether both original attached source documents are fully accessible.
2. Create a comprehensive indexed specification from Source A.
3. Extract the complete relevant requirements for each active worker.
4. Apply the newer requirements above with explicit precedence.
5. Identify and repair any incorrect assumptions previously made because workers lacked these requirements.
6. Redistribute corrected, self-contained assignments to the existing specialists.
7. Continue actual implementation and integration.
8. Preserve all completed verified work.
9. Verify full user journeys.
10. Maintain a truthful completion record.

If a source is inaccessible or truncated, identify exactly which document and sections are missing. Do not claim the requirements were reviewed.

**THE CENTRAL REQUIREMENT: EVERY AGENT MUST KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUILDING.**

Do not replace specifications with feature names.

Do not mistake an agent's interpretation for the user's approved design.

Do not abandon original advanced functionality while implementing new features.

Do not stop at an MVP, superficial integration, or passing tests.

Deliver one coherent HEY containing the original vision and all approved refinements, with independently verified real functionality.

Begin applying this directive to the running engineering operation now.

## Implementation and proof requirements
Work only in your existing assigned checkout/branch. Inspect only your present implementation and preserve stronger work. Implement and wire the complete real user journey in scope; attack authorization, privacy, recovery and failure boundaries. Unit or stubbed tests are contract evidence only. Do not send secrets or claim external/native/provider behavior that was not actually exercised. Commit source changes, preserve handoff, and report exact SHA, tests, live entrypoint/output, frontend/backend/device integration evidence, unresolved blockers and next actions.
