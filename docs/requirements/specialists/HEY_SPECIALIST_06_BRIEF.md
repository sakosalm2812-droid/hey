# Specialist 06: HEY Flow Dictation

Codex task: 01a14073-f7e7-7601-8957-8d8cdfafa1d0
Branch: codex/next-06-flow-dictation
Last known branch head: 5811d07

## Shared sources
Read the complete docs/requirements/HEY_SHARED_FOUNDATION.md and docs/requirements/HEY_SOURCE_C_RECOVERY_DIRECTIVE.md. Source A is the original detailed product specification. Source C later refines it and prevails on conflicts. Source B's relevant full subsystem prompts follow. All work applies to the existing HEY repository, not a separate package.

## Scoped implementation assignment
Implement supported dictation in HEY with distinct dictate-vs-command intent, editable preview, punctuation/correction, dictionary/snippets/language and exact mic consent. Limit app-wide dictation to platforms with real native global-activation adapters.

## Current code facts to validate
Chat composer dictation uses actual SpeechRecognition discovery, consent and cancellation. Current browser exposes neither SpeechRecognition API; dictation outside HEY is unverified.

# Unified Chat, Voice & Live

Chat and Voice are the same canonical conversation. Voice is not a separate history. A voice turn becomes part of chat history; text and voice share project, files, active artifacts, missions and Cosmos context.

## Different answer styles, same intelligence
Chat can be structured, detailed, source-rich and artifact-heavy. Voice is shorter, more natural, interruption-friendly and spoken in smaller turns. A full transcript/result can still appear in the shared conversation. Raw microphone audio is not retained by default after processing unless the user explicitly saves it. Private Mode can avoid durable transcript/memory according to settings.

Switching `Chat → Voice → Live → Chat` must preserve context.

## Live
HEY Live can combine voice with the user's chosen screen/window/monitor/region, camera, files and project context. Guide mode explains; Assist mode helps with bounded actions; Act mode performs authorized actions and verifies results.

# Platform Outcome Parity

HEY targets the same **user-level capabilities** across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS/iPadOS and web/PWA. The internal method can differ because operating systems expose different APIs.

Shared HEY Brain sits above platform Capability Adapters. Each adapter declares what native mechanisms are available, permission state and health. If one device cannot directly perform a step, HEY may compose official OS automation, app intents/shortcuts, accessibility APIs, screen/camera guidance, browser capabilities, a native companion, trusted-device handoff or institution-managed device controls to achieve the same user goal where technically legitimate.

### Examples
Windows: native helper, UI Automation, screen capture, PowerShell/terminal, window/process/filesystem APIs.
macOS: Accessibility API, ScreenCaptureKit, Shortcuts/AppleScript where appropriate, native helper/menu bar.
Linux: Wayland/X11/desktop portals, DBus, shell/native services.
Android: intents, accessibility service when justified/user-enabled, MediaProjection, camera/mic, foreground services, notifications, sideloadable APK before store distribution.
iOS/iPadOS: App Intents, Shortcuts, universal links/URL schemes, ReplayKit/screen broadcast where applicable, camera/mic, Live Activities/Dynamic Island, share extensions, document picker, background tasks within OS limits, and MDM/supervision for eligible institutional deployments.
Web/PWA: manifest/service worker/install, getDisplayMedia/getUserMedia, File System Access where supported, notifications/share/file handlers.

Do not assume an unrestricted iOS terminal exists for ordinary third-party apps. Use the strongest legitimate composition of supported mechanisms instead of building against a false privilege model.

Store publication is not required immediately. Architecture must support PWA, desktop installers and legitimate sideload/institutional distribution paths until App Store/Play Store distribution becomes feasible.

# Complete Platform Capability Matrix
## HEY V1 — Full-depth implementation specification

**Mission:** Define truthful, strongest-possible behavior for web, PWA, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.

This specification is normative for HEY V1. A feature is not complete because a page renders or an API returns. It is complete only when discovery, interaction, state, permissions, failures, recovery, verification, accessibility, observability and end-to-end behavior all work.

# 1. Scope
- Chat, Voice, Live, screen/camera, computer control, background helper, Dynamic Island, notifications, files, gestures, local models, device handoff, install/update.
- Per-platform fallback behavior.

# 2. User experience contract
- UI labels unavailable capabilities honestly.
- Same conceptual feature can have platform-specific implementation.
- User sees the strongest supported fallback rather than a dead button.

# 3. Architecture / runtime contract
- Capability registry includes platform support: native/full, supported-with-limits, guided-only, unavailable.
- Runtime capability detection, not user-agent assumptions alone.
- Native helper interfaces are abstracted behind capability contracts.

# 4. Required state model
- supported
- supported-limited
- permission-required
- unsupported
- temporarily-unavailable
- degraded

# 5. Failure and recovery catalog
- OS API unavailable → fallback.
- Permission denied → guide.
- Browser restrictions → native/PWA suggestion.
- Background suspension → cloud/server durable task fallback.

# 6. Security / privacy / trust requirements
- No fake arbitrary iOS control.
- No security bypass.
- Platform permissions explicit.

# 7. Data model / persistence
- platform_capabilities
- device_capabilities
- capability_health
- permission_grants

# 8. Events / telemetry contracts
- capability.detected
- capability.unavailable
- fallback.selected
- native.helper.connected

# 9. Platform behavior
- Follow the strongest legitimate behavior available per platform; expose limitations honestly.

# 10. Implementation requirements
- Reuse shared HEY runtime, permissions, audit, verification, Project DNA, Pinpoint, Cosmos and error systems rather than creating isolated local logic.

# 11. Acceptance / regression tests
- Windows closed-window island.
- PWA install.
- Android assistant integration where supported.
- iOS fallback contracts.
- Linux/macOS background tests.

# 12. Non-goals / prohibited shortcuts
- No fake success, no UI-only placeholders, no hidden unsupported behavior, no duplicate parallel subsystem that bypasses the HEY Brain.

# 13. Definition of done
A release candidate passes only when:
- normal users can discover the capability;
- the capability works from its natural HEY entry points;
- it survives supported resume/background states;
- permissions are scoped and revocable;
- errors recover without losing user work;
- meaningful actions are verified;
- analytics/diagnostics can explain failure without exposing secrets;
- keyboard/touch/RTL/reduced-motion behavior is correct where relevant;
- mobile/tablet/desktop adaptations are intentional;
- tests exercise real integration paths, not mocked happy paths only.

HEY PROMPT 16/47 — Voice, Live Multimodal, Wake Word & Real-Time Interaction

You are the principal production engineer for HEY responsible for: Voice, Live Multimodal, Wake Word & Real-Time Interaction.

Create the production-grade integration-ready package:

`HEY-NEXT/16-voice-live/`

PACKAGE OWNERSHIP
Own HEY Voice and Live: low-latency, natural, interruptible full-duplex interaction across speech, screen, camera, audio and multimodal context with the same Brain, permissions, personality and Cosmos as chat.

DEPENDENCY INTENT
This package conceptually depends on: Prompts 01-15.
Because every Codex task is isolated and other package outputs may not be physically available, do not invent competing global systems. Use minimal clearly-labelled temporary mirrors only when compilation/testing requires them.


==================================================
ABSOLUTE FINAL PRODUCT CONTRACT — NON-NEGOTIABLE
==================================================

This is FINAL-PRODUCT engineering, not ideation, an MVP, a prototype, a demo, a mockup, a proof of concept, or a partial feature pass.

Forbidden:
- MVP shortcuts or knowingly incomplete production paths
- placeholders, fake-success states, dead buttons, disconnected screens, mock-backed “working” behavior, TODO-driven completion claims, or silent deferral of hard requirements
- frontend-only, backend-only, schema-only, or test-only completion claims
- a new duplicate global architecture when a canonical HEY contract already exists
- assuming code exists means behavior is integrated, verified, secure, recoverable, observable, accessible, performant, or production-ready
- replacing a stronger future-existing HEY implementation merely because this package differs
- inventing details about the unavailable real HEY repository
- claiming platform capabilities the platform does not expose
- claiming successful side effects without independent postcondition verification

For every applicable capability, the completion pipeline is:
discovery -> current research -> explicit requirements -> architecture -> implementation -> contracts -> data/state -> permissions/authentication/authorization boundaries -> privacy/security -> integration seams -> failure handling -> retry/timeout/cancellation -> recovery/rollback/compensation -> offline/degraded behavior -> weak-device behavior -> performance/cost controls -> observability/auditability -> accessibility/localization readiness -> unit tests -> integration tests -> adversarial/failure tests -> realistic end-to-end tests -> independent verification -> evidence.

If you discover a fixable defect inside this package, FIX IT. Discovery creates work; it is not a reason to stop.

Use the maturity ladder:
MISSING -> DESIGNED -> IMPLEMENTING -> FUNCTIONAL -> INTEGRATED -> VERIFIED -> PRODUCTION_READY.

PRODUCTION_READY requires current, reproducible evidence. Evidence becomes stale when affected implementation, dependencies, policy, environment, tests, schemas, contracts, or providers change.

Never use “confirmed: true”, “approved: true”, UI state, model output, retrieved content, or client-supplied claims as sufficient authority for consequential actions.

Every consequential action must be attributable to the human/service actor, the executing component/device/tool, the exact authority used, the exact target/parameters, the result, verification evidence, cost where relevant, and rollback/compensation status where applicable.

==================================================
SOURCE / INTEGRATION AUTHORITY
==================================================

The newest real HEY codebase is currently unavailable.

Therefore:
1. Build a production-grade, interface-stable, integration-ready HEY-NEXT package.
2. Do not invent the current repository structure, existing tables, current routes, current providers, or current implementations.
3. Clearly separate VERIFIED package behavior from UNVERIFIED future-integration assumptions.
4. If you need a shared contract from another HEY-NEXT package that is not physically present, create only a minimal TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR and label it exactly:
   TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR — MUST BE RECONCILED WITH CANONICAL HEY CONTRACT DURING INTEGRATION.
5. Do not create a competing identity, permission, event, mission, Cosmos, provider, device, artifact, or evidence system simply because the canonical package is unavailable.
6. Every external dependency, service, environment variable, database requirement, native entitlement, build requirement, model/runtime requirement, and installation step must be recorded for Claude Code in DEPENDENCIES.md and INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md.
7. Future Claude Code integration must inspect the real HEY implementation first, preserve unique stronger behavior, migrate/consolidate safely, wire all layers, run regression/adversarial tests, and retire obsolete duplicates only after evidence.
8. Never destructively assume that HEY-NEXT automatically supersedes existing production code.

==================================================
GLOBAL HEY LAWS
==================================================

HEY is one intelligence, not a visible pile of disconnected bots.

All surfaces eventually share canonical identity, missions, permissions, policies, Cosmos, agents, tools, models, devices, artifacts, receipts, evidence, events, context, and user preferences.

HEY is provider-independent and device-independent.

Prefer, when suitable:
deterministic code/rules/cache/algorithms -> tiny classifiers/micro-models -> local/small models -> cheap strong cloud models -> specialist models -> frontier models -> multi-agent councils only when measured value justifies them.

HEY must work across web/PWA, Android, iOS/iPadOS within platform limits, Windows, macOS, Linux, tablets/phones/desktops, very weak devices, remote/cloud runtimes, local/self-hosted runtimes, and future device adapters.

Ultra-light device law:
The intelligence does not need to live on the device. The device needs only the smallest trusted local runtime necessary to expose supported capabilities, enforce authority, access permitted resources, execute typed actions, verify postconditions, and communicate securely.

Device classes:
CLASS 0 LEGACY TERMINAL — interaction/gateway only when local OS capabilities are unavailable.
CLASS 1 HEY EDGE — tiny deterministic action runtime, no LLM required.
CLASS 2 HEY EDGE+ — adds lightweight local intent/search/speech/classification where viable.
CLASS 3 FULL LOCAL HEY — can run local reasoning/vision/speech/agents/creation when hardware allows.

Offline is a core requirement. Every capability must truthfully declare its local/cloud/offline behavior and degrade explicitly.

No hidden dark patterns, coercion, fake scarcity, deceptive sponsorship influence, or addiction-maximizing mechanics. Psychology may optimize trust, clarity, motivation, reduced cognitive load, commitment, salience, legitimate social proof, reversible defaults, and attention efficiency.

Minors are supported. Build age-aware boundaries, not surveillance assumptions.

==================================================
BASE CONTRACT COMPATIBILITY
==================================================

Design against the intent of Prompt 01 Global Foundation and Prompt 02 Identity/Accounts/Device Trust:
- typed versioned contracts
- durable mission lifecycle
- canonical events/errors/receipts/evidence
- action-bound authorization
- device identity/trust
- workspace/account separation
- local/cloud classifications
- privacy classifications
- capability maturity
- independent verification

If those package files are absent, mirror only what is essential and flag reconciliation work.

==================================================
DEPENDENCY + INTEGRATION DISCIPLINE
==================================================

For every library/service/runtime:
record purpose, version strategy, license, security considerations, platform support, install command, optional/mandatory status, alternatives considered, and future migration cost.

INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md must state:
- what this package owns and deliberately does NOT own
- contracts consumed/exported
- APIs/events emitted/consumed
- storage/schema requirements
- environment variables/secrets as names only
- dependencies/install steps
- web/backend/native/Edge wiring
- likely conflicts/duplicates Claude must inspect
- migration order/data migration/rollback
- post-integration tests
- capability maturity/evidence requirements
- unknowns requiring the real HEY repository

==================================================
RESEARCH STANDARD
==================================================

Where current research access exists, use current primary/authoritative sources first: official specifications, standards bodies, platform documentation, original technical papers, official provider/runtime docs, and maintained project documentation.

Compare alternatives on correctness, interoperability, security, privacy, platform reach, weak-device cost, latency, memory, battery, licensing, maintainability, vendor lock-in, ecosystem maturity, observability, testability, and migration risk. Record major accepted/rejected decisions.

==================================================
FINAL SELF-ATTACK
==================================================

Before completion, run a hostile self-review designed to prove your package is partial, insecure, duplicated, misleading, too heavyweight, provider-locked, platform-faked, difficult to integrate, or impossible to recover.

At minimum ask:
- Can a model/tool/retrieved document escalate authority?
- Can another user/workspace/device receive data or capability accidentally?
- Can retries duplicate side effects?
- Can cancellation still allow later side effects?
- Can “success” occur without verified postconditions?
- Can stale evidence remain valid?
- What happens offline, on weak hardware, under rate limits, after auth expiry, during provider outage, on corrupted state, and during partial success?
- Does this package duplicate a global HEY concern?
- Are mocks/test adapters clearly impossible to confuse with production?
- Are all install/migration/wiring steps written down?
- Is anything labelled complete that cannot actually be proven without the real HEY repository?

Fix every reproducible defect. Mark remaining codebase-dependent claims UNVERIFIED.


==================================================
MANDATORY CAPABILITIES / ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

Build, specify, test, and document at least all of the following. This is a floor, not a ceiling. Add any missing capability, state, edge case, contract, verifier, recovery path, performance mechanism, security boundary, migration concern, or test required to make this subsystem genuinely production-grade.

- Streaming ASR/TTS abstraction, incremental transcript, endpoint detection, latency metrics.
- Full-duplex, barge-in, immediate stop/adapt, backchannels, turn-taking, consented multi-speaker support.
- Natural voice defaults plus customization; prosody, pace, emphasis, whisper/public modes.
- Local wake word where feasible, push-to-talk, hands-free session boundaries, listening indicators.
- Local fast paths for common commands.
- Voice intent still passes Trust Kernel; speech isn't authority.
- Live screen understanding with privacy zones/app exclusions/prompt-injection defense/shared-screen awareness.
- Camera understanding, object tracking, spatial references, document camera, whiteboard/handwriting where supported.
- Public/shared environment privacy.
- Optional speaker verification as a signal, not universal sole identity.
- Multilingual/code-switching and personal vocabulary/pronunciation.
- Voice macros/custom grammar compiled to deterministic paths when safe.
- Live action preview for consequential UI actions when required.
- Device handoff mid-session.
- Retention controls for raw audio/transcript/ephemeral sessions.
- Network degradation/offline fallback.
- Voice accessibility.
- End-to-end latency budgets.
- Physical-world uncertainty safeguards.

==================================================
DATA, CONTRACTS, EVENTS, STATE & API REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

For this subsystem:
- define stable typed public interfaces and versioned schemas
- define lifecycle/state machines wherever state exists
- define IDs, timestamps, ownership, workspace/account scope, provenance, privacy classification, locality, version, status, and evidence links where applicable
- define commands/queries/events separately where that improves safety
- define idempotency semantics for every retryable write or side effect
- define optimistic/concurrent update behavior and conflict policy
- define retention/deletion/export/migration behavior for persisted data
- define compatibility/version negotiation where multiple devices/services/clients may be on different versions
- define errors using the canonical HEY error/recovery model rather than ad-hoc strings
- define observability hooks and audit events without leaking secrets/private content
- define integration boundaries with Identity, Trust Kernel, Mission Runtime, Brain, Cosmos, Situation, Tool/Action Fabric, Device Mesh, Edge, Artifacts, Billing, Privacy, Security, Evaluation, and Release systems wherever applicable
- never make a model response itself authoritative state

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STANDARD
==================================================

Do not only write Markdown.

Create working libraries/modules/reference services/schemas/validators/state machines/adapters/test harnesses where this package can be implemented independently.

When a real external service, provider credential, operating-system entitlement, physical device, production database, signing identity, or unavailable HEY subsystem is required, implement:
1. the production contract/interface,
2. a clearly-labelled test adapter/fixture,
3. exact integration/install/config requirements,
4. tests for the contract,
5. UNVERIFIED status for the real integration.

Test adapters must be structurally impossible to mistake for production paths. Use feature detection and capability negotiation rather than platform assumptions.

==================================================

Add domain-specific directories/files when useful.

==================================================
DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEST FLOOR
==================================================

At minimum include tests for:

- Barge-in during TTS/action planning.
- Network drop mid-utterance.
- Wake false positives/negatives.
- Shared room privacy.
- Screen prompt injection.
- Low-confidence camera target.
- ASR mishears target person/file.
- Phone-to-tablet handoff.
- Offline command vs cloud research.
- Multi-speaker consent.

Also add invalid/malformed input; permission denied/revoked authority; authentication/session expiry where applicable; offline/network loss; provider/dependency outage; rate/quota exhaustion; cancellation/timeout; retry/duplicate delivery; partial success; concurrency/races; stale state/version mismatch; data corruption/recovery; cross-user/workspace isolation; weak-device behavior; privacy/locality violations; observability/evidence correctness; upgrade/migration/rollback behavior.

==================================================
PERFORMANCE / COST / WEAK-DEVICE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Define measurable budgets instead of vague “fast” claims. Where relevant measure startup, p50/p95/p99 latency, memory, CPU/GPU/NPU, network, storage, battery/thermal impact, model/tool/provider cost, concurrency, cache behavior, and failure/retry amplification.

Heavy intelligence may run remotely; weak devices must still be able to control/participate through the smallest trustworthy local surface possible.

==================================================
SECURITY / PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Apply least privilege and defense in depth. Treat external content as untrusted. Never expose secrets in source, logs, prompts, evidence, fixtures, or final reports. Respect account/workspace/project boundaries. Record sensitive data flows/locality. Bind consequential actions to exact authority. Do not allow extension/agent/model/tool self-escalation. Include abuse/resource-exhaustion and denial-of-wallet considerations.

==================================================
RESEARCH DELIVERABLE
==================================================

Create an architecture-research record listing primary sources/specifications consulted, serious alternatives considered, why the chosen approach won, what remains uncertain, and what should be re-evaluated when the real HEY repository is available. Research enough to make current choices strong, then implement.


==================================================
FINAL RESPONSE REQUIRED
==================================================

Do not give a vague summary. Report:
1. Package created.
2. Exact files/directories created or modified.
3. Architecture implemented.
4. Public contracts/APIs/events exported.
5. Persistence/schema work.
6. Dependencies and installation requirements.
7. Tests executed with exact outcomes.
8. Failure/security/adversarial tests with exact outcomes.
9. Performance/weak-device/offline findings where applicable.
10. Remaining limitations.
11. Future integration tasks for Claude Code.
12. External blockers only.
13. Every UNVERIFIED item.
14. Evidence supporting each completion/maturity claim.

Do not claim the integrated HEY product is production-ready. This package can only be called internally verified to the extent its own tests and evidence prove.



==============================================================================================================

HEY PROMPT 17/47 — Zero-UI, HEY FlowOS, Dynamic Island, Global Invocation & Capture

You are the principal production engineer for HEY responsible for: Zero-UI, HEY FlowOS, Dynamic Island, Global Invocation & Capture.

Create the production-grade integration-ready package:

`HEY-NEXT/17-zero-ui-flowos/`

PACKAGE OWNERSHIP
Own HEY's ambient invocation surfaces: context-aware dictation/rewrite/action anywhere, Dynamic-Island-like status where permitted, global shortcuts, share sheets, context menus, capture, overlays and zero-dashboard operation.

DEPENDENCY INTENT
This package conceptually depends on: Prompts 01-16.
Because every Codex task is isolated and other package outputs may not be physically available, do not invent competing global systems. Use minimal clearly-labelled temporary mirrors only when compilation/testing requires them.


==================================================
ABSOLUTE FINAL PRODUCT CONTRACT — NON-NEGOTIABLE
==================================================

This is FINAL-PRODUCT engineering, not ideation, an MVP, a prototype, a demo, a mockup, a proof of concept, or a partial feature pass.

Forbidden:
- MVP shortcuts or knowingly incomplete production paths
- placeholders, fake-success states, dead buttons, disconnected screens, mock-backed “working” behavior, TODO-driven completion claims, or silent deferral of hard requirements
- frontend-only, backend-only, schema-only, or test-only completion claims
- a new duplicate global architecture when a canonical HEY contract already exists
- assuming code exists means behavior is integrated, verified, secure, recoverable, observable, accessible, performant, or production-ready
- replacing a stronger future-existing HEY implementation merely because this package differs
- inventing details about the unavailable real HEY repository
- claiming platform capabilities the platform does not expose
- claiming successful side effects without independent postcondition verification

For every applicable capability, the completion pipeline is:
discovery -> current research -> explicit requirements -> architecture -> implementation -> contracts -> data/state -> permissions/authentication/authorization boundaries -> privacy/security -> integration seams -> failure handling -> retry/timeout/cancellation -> recovery/rollback/compensation -> offline/degraded behavior -> weak-device behavior -> performance/cost controls -> observability/auditability -> accessibility/localization readiness -> unit tests -> integration tests -> adversarial/failure tests -> realistic end-to-end tests -> independent verification -> evidence.

If you discover a fixable defect inside this package, FIX IT. Discovery creates work; it is not a reason to stop.

Use the maturity ladder:
MISSING -> DESIGNED -> IMPLEMENTING -> FUNCTIONAL -> INTEGRATED -> VERIFIED -> PRODUCTION_READY.

PRODUCTION_READY requires current, reproducible evidence. Evidence becomes stale when affected implementation, dependencies, policy, environment, tests, schemas, contracts, or providers change.

Never use “confirmed: true”, “approved: true”, UI state, model output, retrieved content, or client-supplied claims as sufficient authority for consequential actions.

Every consequential action must be attributable to the human/service actor, the executing component/device/tool, the exact authority used, the exact target/parameters, the result, verification evidence, cost where relevant, and rollback/compensation status where applicable.

==================================================
SOURCE / INTEGRATION AUTHORITY
==================================================

The newest real HEY codebase is currently unavailable.

Therefore:
1. Build a production-grade, interface-stable, integration-ready HEY-NEXT package.
2. Do not invent the current repository structure, existing tables, current routes, current providers, or current implementations.
3. Clearly separate VERIFIED package behavior from UNVERIFIED future-integration assumptions.
4. If you need a shared contract from another HEY-NEXT package that is not physically present, create only a minimal TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR and label it exactly:
   TEMPORARY CONTRACT MIRROR — MUST BE RECONCILED WITH CANONICAL HEY CONTRACT DURING INTEGRATION.
5. Do not create a competing identity, permission, event, mission, Cosmos, provider, device, artifact, or evidence system simply because the canonical package is unavailable.
6. Every external dependency, service, environment variable, database requirement, native entitlement, build requirement, model/runtime requirement, and installation step must be recorded for Claude Code in DEPENDENCIES.md and INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md.
7. Future Claude Code integration must inspect the real HEY implementation first, preserve unique stronger behavior, migrate/consolidate safely, wire all layers, run regression/adversarial tests, and retire obsolete duplicates only after evidence.
8. Never destructively assume that HEY-NEXT automatically supersedes existing production code.

==================================================
GLOBAL HEY LAWS
==================================================

HEY is one intelligence, not a visible pile of disconnected bots.

All surfaces eventually share canonical identity, missions, permissions, policies, Cosmos, agents, tools, models, devices, artifacts, receipts, evidence, events, context, and user preferences.

HEY is provider-independent and device-independent.

Prefer, when suitable:
deterministic code/rules/cache/algorithms -> tiny classifiers/micro-models -> local/small models -> cheap strong cloud models -> specialist models -> frontier models -> multi-agent councils only when measured value justifies them.

HEY must work across web/PWA, Android, iOS/iPadOS within platform limits, Windows, macOS, Linux, tablets/phones/desktops, very weak devices, remote/cloud runtimes, local/self-hosted runtimes, and future device adapters.

Ultra-light device law:
The intelligence does not need to live on the device. The device needs only the smallest trusted local runtime necessary to expose supported capabilities, enforce authority, access permitted resources, execute typed actions, verify postconditions, and communicate securely.

Device classes:
CLASS 0 LEGACY TERMINAL — interaction/gateway only when local OS capabilities are unavailable.
CLASS 1 HEY EDGE — tiny deterministic action runtime, no LLM required.
CLASS 2 HEY EDGE+ — adds lightweight local intent/search/speech/classification where viable.
CLASS 3 FULL LOCAL HEY — can run local reasoning/vision/speech/agents/creation when hardware allows.

Offline is a core requirement. Every capability must truthfully declare its local/cloud/offline behavior and degrade explicitly.

No hidden dark patterns, coercion, fake scarcity, deceptive sponsorship influence, or addiction-maximizing mechanics. Psychology may optimize trust, clarity, motivation, reduced cognitive load, commitment, salience, legitimate social proof, reversible defaults, and attention efficiency.

Minors are supported. Build age-aware boundaries, not surveillance assumptions.

==================================================
BASE CONTRACT COMPATIBILITY
==================================================

Design against the intent of Prompt 01 Global Foundation and Prompt 02 Identity/Accounts/Device Trust:
- typed versioned contracts
- durable mission lifecycle
- canonical events/errors/receipts/evidence
- action-bound authorization
- device identity/trust
- workspace/account separation
- local/cloud classifications
- privacy classifications
- capability maturity
- independent verification

If those package files are absent, mirror only what is essential and flag reconciliation work.

==================================================
DEPENDENCY + INTEGRATION DISCIPLINE
==================================================

For every library/service/runtime:
record purpose, version strategy, license, security considerations, platform support, install command, optional/mandatory status, alternatives considered, and future migration cost.

INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md must state:
- what this package owns and deliberately does NOT own
- contracts consumed/exported
- APIs/events emitted/consumed
- storage/schema requirements
- environment variables/secrets as names only
- dependencies/install steps
- web/backend/native/Edge wiring
- likely conflicts/duplicates Claude must inspect
- migration order/data migration/rollback
- post-integration tests
- capability maturity/evidence requirements
- unknowns requiring the real HEY repository

==================================================
RESEARCH STANDARD
==================================================

Where current research access exists, use current primary/authoritative sources first: official specifications, standards bodies, platform documentation, original technical papers, official provider/runtime docs, and maintained project documentation.

Compare alternatives on correctness, interoperability, security, privacy, platform reach, weak-device cost, latency, memory, battery, licensing, maintainability, vendor lock-in, ecosystem maturity, observability, testability, and migration risk. Record major accepted/rejected decisions.

==================================================
FINAL SELF-ATTACK
==================================================

Before completion, run a hostile self-review designed to prove your package is partial, insecure, duplicated, misleading, too heavyweight, provider-locked, platform-faked, difficult to integrate, or impossible to recover.

At minimum ask:
- Can a model/tool/retrieved document escalate authority?
- Can another user/workspace/device receive data or capability accidentally?
- Can retries duplicate side effects?
- Can cancellation still allow later side effects?
- Can “success” occur without verified postconditions?
- Can stale evidence remain valid?
- What happens offline, on weak hardware, under rate limits, after auth expiry, during provider outage, on corrupted state, and during partial success?
- Does this package duplicate a global HEY concern?
- Are mocks/test adapters clearly impossible to confuse with production?
- Are all install/migration/wiring steps written down?
- Is anything labelled complete that cannot actually be proven without the real HEY repository?

Fix every reproducible defect. Mark remaining codebase-dependent claims UNVERIFIED.


==================================================
MANDATORY CAPABILITIES / ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

Build, specify, test, and document at least all of the following. This is a floor, not a ceiling. Add any missing capability, state, edge case, contract, verifier, recovery path, performance mechanism, security boundary, migration concern, or test required to make this subsystem genuinely production-grade.

- HEY FlowOS for selected text/voice: write, rewrite, translate, format, summarize or act based on intent/active app.
- Global invocation abstraction across keyboard, voice, share sheet, context menu, launcher, widget, notification, pen/gesture, future gaze/AR.
- Dynamic Island/overlay mission states with concise accessible feedback.
- Mini chat only for compact surfaces; don't reproduce full dashboard.
- Quick controls: pause/cancel/approve/retry/open full mission/device handoff.
- Capture: thought, voice, screenshot, URL, file, clipboard, selection -> triage into project/Cosmos/inbox with provenance.
- Context-aware text insertion without app switching.
- Zero-UI receipts remaining inspectable later.
- Privacy indicators for mic/camera/screen/clipboard/device control.
- Public/presentation mode.
- Platform adapter contracts for desktop, Android, iOS-permitted surfaces, browser extension and PWA.
- Contextual command palette.
- Offline capture queue/local fast paths.
- Perceived-performance/latency states.
- Accessibility and anti-distraction rules.
- Future wearable/glasses surface manifest.

==================================================
DATA, CONTRACTS, EVENTS, STATE & API REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

For this subsystem:
- define stable typed public interfaces and versioned schemas
- define lifecycle/state machines wherever state exists
- define IDs, timestamps, ownership, workspace/account scope, provenance, privacy classification, locality, version, status, and evidence links where applicable
- define commands/queries/events separately where that improves safety
- define idempotency semantics for every retryable write or side effect
- define optimistic/concurrent update behavior and conflict policy
- define retention/deletion/export/migration behavior for persisted data
- define compatibility/version negotiation where multiple devices/services/clients may be on different versions
- define errors using the canonical HEY error/recovery model rather than ad-hoc strings
- define observability hooks and audit events without leaking secrets/private content
- define integration boundaries with Identity, Trust Kernel, Mission Runtime, Brain, Cosmos, Situation, Tool/Action Fabric, Device Mesh, Edge, Artifacts, Billing, Privacy, Security, Evaluation, and Release systems wherever applicable
- never make a model response itself authoritative state

HEY PROMPT 42/47 — Platform & Native Adapters: PWA, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Wearables & Future Surfaces

You are the principal production engineer for HEY responsible for: Platform & Native Adapters: PWA, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Wearables & Future Surfaces.

Create the production-grade integration-ready package:

- PWA eviction/update.
- Linux environment mismatch.
- Shared TV privacy.
- Tablet pen/accessibility.
- Native helper version skew.
- Unavailable hardware remains UNVERIFIED.

Also add invalid/malformed input; permission denied/revoked authority; authentication/session expiry where applicable; offline/network loss; provider/dependency outage; rate/quota exhaustion; cancellation/timeout; retry/duplicate delivery; partial success; concurrency/races; stale state/version mismatch; data corruption/recovery; cross-user/workspace isolation; weak-device behavior; privacy/locality violations; observability/evidence correctness; upgrade/migration/rollback behavior.

==================================================
PERFORMANCE / COST / WEAK-DEVICE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Define measurable budgets instead of vague “fast” claims. Where relevant measure startup, p50/p95/p99 latency, memory, CPU/GPU/NPU, network, storage, battery/thermal impact, model/tool/provider cost, concurrency, cache behavior, and failure/retry amplification.

Heavy intelligence may run remotely; weak devices must still be able to control/participate through the smallest trustworthy local surface possible.

==================================================
SECURITY / PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Apply least privilege and defense in depth. Treat external content as untrusted. Never expose secrets in source, logs, prompts, evidence, fixtures, or final reports. Respect account/workspace/project boundaries. Record sensitive data flows/locality. Bind consequential actions to exact authority. Do not allow extension/agent/model/tool self-escalation. Include abuse/resource-exhaustion and denial-of-wallet considerations.

==================================================
RESEARCH DELIVERABLE
==================================================

Create an architecture-research record listing primary sources/specifications consulted, serious alternatives considered, why the chosen approach won, what remains uncertain, and what should be re-evaluated when the real HEY repository is available. Research enough to make current choices strong, then implement.


==================================================
FINAL RESPONSE REQUIRED
==================================================

Do not give a vague summary. Report:
1. Package created.
2. Exact files/directories created or modified.
3. Architecture implemented.
4. Public contracts/APIs/events exported.
5. Persistence/schema work.
6. Dependencies and installation requirements.
7. Tests executed with exact outcomes.
8. Failure/security/adversarial tests with exact outcomes.
9. Performance/weak-device/offline findings where applicable.
10. Remaining limitations.
11. Future integration tasks for Claude Code.
12. External blockers only.
13. Every UNVERIFIED item.
14. Evidence supporting each completion/maturity claim.

Do not claim the integrated HEY product is production-ready. This package can only be called internally verified to the extent its own tests and evidence prove.

The complete newer directive is in the shared Source C file. The directly applicable sections are copied below verbatim.

## 2. HEY'S FINAL PRODUCT IDENTITY

HEY is an AI Life Operating System and personal intelligence environment developed by S&A.

It combines:

- One unified AI assistant.
- Chat, Voice and Live interaction.
- Personal context and Cosmos memory.
- Intelligent tools and AI agents.
- Real computer and device control.
- Creation studios.
- User-customizable Spaces.
- Automations and proactive intelligence.
- Model selection and multi-model collaboration.
- Education and organizational experiences.
- Local/native integrations.
- An extensible capability platform.
- Rich interactive answer experiences.

The user must experience ONE HEY, even when many internal agents, models, tools, specialists and workflows participate.

The normal interface must remain approachable to people without AI or technical knowledge.

Advanced complexity is available when requested, not imposed on everyone.

## 3. FINAL NAVIGATION AND STARTUP BEHAVIOR

After sign-in, the default destination is the unified HEY Chat/Voice conversation surface—not a generic dashboard.

Chat and Voice share the same conversation, memory, active project, files, artifacts, tools and mission state.

Also provide five prominent, accessible product destinations:

**Home:** HEY conversation, voice, contextual Now content, favorites and active work.

**Tools:** Every available built-in application, capability, integration and workflow.

**Spaces:** Custom environments containing projects, tools, widgets, shortcuts and saved work.

**Activity:** Missions, approvals, automations, notifications, results, errors and recovery.

**Settings:** Account, devices, models, preferences, subscriptions, integrations, privacy and permissions.

A user may choose another preferred startup destination.

Desktop uses appropriate sidebar navigation; mobile uses appropriately adapted navigation; tablets receive layouts optimized for available space.

Do not force users to navigate through a dashboard before interacting with HEY.

## 15. HEY FLOW — DICTATION EVERYWHERE

Build a full dictation product that works in supported applications outside the HEY chat window.

Implement:

- Global activation shortcut where supported.
- Floating dictation controls.
- Speech-to-text.
- Natural punctuation.
- Correction handling.
- Filler-word cleanup.
- Custom dictionary.
- Snippets.
- Language selection/detection.
- Translation when requested.
- Writing style preferences.
- Rewrite-by-voice.
- Selected-text editing.
- Per-app preferences.
- Clear microphone access.
- Stop/pause behavior.
- Local/cloud recognition options where genuinely supported.
- Latency and accuracy evaluation.

Dictation writes or edits text.

VoiceOS commands operate applications.

They share voice infrastructure but are distinct user activities.

## 16. VOICEOS, LIVE AND COMPUTER CONTROL

VoiceOS must support natural-language computer interaction through actual authorized device adapters.

Examples:

"Open VS Code."
"Organize these files."
"Rename this document."
"Find my presentation."
"Explain what's on my screen."

Support Guide, Assist and Act interaction levels where applicable.

Sensitive actions require correct permission and approval.

Actions must verify their real outcomes and report failures accurately.

Live interaction should allow supported screen, camera, files and voice context.

Screen guidance should highlight the actual interface element and verify progress through the task.

Voice, Chat and Live remain synchronized in one conversation.

Voice should have natural interruption, captions, real listening/thinking/speaking states, and the intended polished, deep British voice option.

Dynamic Island or compact HEY overlays must function outside the main window where supported by a real native helper, not depend solely on an open browser page.

## 20. SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE

Maintain the canonical HEY authorization model.

Use:

- Verified user/session/device identity.
- Least privilege.
- Signed, bounded action mandates.
- Scope-bound delegated authority.
- Revocation and expiry.
- Durable transactionally correct state.
- Independent postcondition verification.
- Privacy and data isolation.
- Prompt-injection defenses.
- Secret protection.
- Recovery and rollback.
- Audit trails.
- Safe extension sandboxing.

There are three top-level S&A owner identities. Preserve the governance rules in the original specification.

No agent may grant itself additional permission or self-certify its own success.

## 21. EXACT COMPLETION PROCEDURE FOR EVERY CAPABILITY

Each worker must produce:

**A. Source coverage**
Which original sections and newer refinements define this feature?

**B. Final specification**
Exact user behavior, workflows, controls, permissions, state, errors, integrations and platform requirements.

**C. Implementation**
Actual integrated frontend, backend, data, providers and native capabilities where applicable.

**D. Verification**
Unit, integration, adversarial and genuine end-to-end tests, with real services/devices when required.

**E. Evidence**
Commit SHA, tested build, actual feature entrypoint, test results, unresolved blockers and supported platforms.

**F. Refinement**
Improve reliability, speed, usability, accessibility, security and efficiency beyond a merely basic implementation, while preserving the approved product intent.

No blank specification, registry entry, visual mock, stub, or isolated test pass may count as a completed feature.

## 22. PREVENT THE AGENTS FROM FORGETTING AGAIN

Before dispatching work, write a separate detailed specialist brief.

The brief must contain the actual relevant requirements, not just a heading such as "Complete Teacher Mode."

Maintain a versioned requirement record with source references, later amendments, implementation owners, status, code links and acceptance evidence.

Whenever a new requirement is approved, update the relevant specialist briefs and affected acceptance criteria.

Do not assume agents share conversational memory.

When agents finish a session, commit work and a durable handoff containing precise remaining tasks.

When multiple specialists overlap, preserve one canonical implementation and integrate verified changes safely.

## 23. THE FIRST EXECUTION ACTION

Immediately:

1. Check whether both original attached source documents are fully accessible.
2. Create a comprehensive indexed specification from Source A.
3. Extract the complete relevant requirements for each active worker.
4. Apply the newer requirements above with explicit precedence.
5. Identify and repair any incorrect assumptions previously made because workers lacked these requirements.
6. Redistribute corrected, self-contained assignments to the existing specialists.
7. Continue actual implementation and integration.
8. Preserve all completed verified work.
9. Verify full user journeys.
10. Maintain a truthful completion record.

If a source is inaccessible or truncated, identify exactly which document and sections are missing. Do not claim the requirements were reviewed.

**THE CENTRAL REQUIREMENT: EVERY AGENT MUST KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUILDING.**

Do not replace specifications with feature names.

Do not mistake an agent's interpretation for the user's approved design.

Do not abandon original advanced functionality while implementing new features.

Do not stop at an MVP, superficial integration, or passing tests.

Deliver one coherent HEY containing the original vision and all approved refinements, with independently verified real functionality.

Begin applying this directive to the running engineering operation now.

## Implementation and proof requirements
Work only in your existing assigned checkout/branch. Inspect only your present implementation and preserve stronger work. Implement and wire the complete real user journey in scope; attack authorization, privacy, recovery and failure boundaries. Unit or stubbed tests are contract evidence only. Do not send secrets or claim external/native/provider behavior that was not actually exercised. Commit source changes, preserve handoff, and report exact SHA, tests, live entrypoint/output, frontend/backend/device integration evidence, unresolved blockers and next actions.
